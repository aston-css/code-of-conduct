# ACSS Code of Conduct

All members of the society and external attendees (both hereby referred to as "members") at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The committee will enforce this code at all times, and we expect full cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody, regardless of differences.

## Summary

* Be kind and courteous at all times.
* Harassment is not tolerated in any form. If asked to stop doing something, stop.
* Failure to adhere may result in being banned from future events.

## Expectations

We want the society to be a welcoming place for all. Members are expected to respect this by being kind and courteous at all times. Disputes should be resolved amicably where possible, but will be escalated to the committee and dealt with through official Aston Student' Union procedure where required.

Harassment will not be tolerated in any form. This includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices and level of skill. Neither will we tolerate engaging in or encouraging sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

When asked to stop doing something, even if not personally considered to be harassment, members are expected to comply immediately. If a member engages in harassing behaviour, the committee may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the event, or barring from future events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please immediately contact any member of the committee.

We expect members to follow these rules at events and socials, while attending external events as part of the society, and in our online communities such as our Facebook group and Slack team.
